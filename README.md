 Railways-DataBase-Management-System
A database management to store the data of passengers and dynamically updates the data.


Certainly! Let's walk through what the code does, step by step.

 1. Introduction
This is a Python program that creates a simple web server to manage a basic railway management system. The system lets users log in, purchase tickets, check ticket status, cancel tickets, and manage their account settings.

 2. Imports and Dependencies
The program uses several Python libraries:
- `http.server`: To handle HTTP requests and create a web server.
- `cgi`: To handle form data submitted via HTTP POST requests.
- `cx_Oracle`: To interact with an Oracle database, where user information and tickets are stored.
- `datetime`: To handle date and time-related operations.
- `random`: To generate random numbers, such as PNR numbers for tickets.
- `os`: To interact with the operating system, particularly for handling file paths.

 3. Database Connection
- The program connects to an Oracle database using credentials defined at the beginning.
- There’s a function to establish a connection to the database, handling any connection errors that might occur.

 4. Database Setup
- The program ensures the necessary tables (`accounts` and `tickets`) exist in the database. If they don’t, it creates them.
  - `accounts` table: Stores user information like ID, password, name, gender, age, date of birth, and phone number.
  - `tickets` table: Stores ticket information like ID, PNR, train name, date of journey, and departure and destination stations.
- The setup process also ensures that certain columns, like the date of journey, are correctly formatted as dates.

 5. Handling HTTP Requests
- The program has a request handler class that manages different types of HTTP requests (GET and POST).
  - GET Requests: Used to retrieve web pages or resources like CSS files.
  - POST Requests: Used to submit data to the server, like login credentials or ticket purchase information.

 6. Login System
- The program displays a login page where users can enter their ID and password.
- When the user submits the form, the server checks the database to see if the credentials are correct.
- If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the main menu; otherwise, they are shown an error message.

 7. Main Menu and Actions
- After logging in, users see a main menu with several options:
  - Purchase Ticket: Users can enter train details and purchase a ticket. The system generates a random PNR and stores the ticket in the database.
  - Check Ticket Status: Users can enter their PNR to view the details of their ticket.
  - Cancel Ticket: Users can request to cancel a ticket by entering the PNR. The ticket is then removed from the database.
  - Account Settings: Although not fully implemented in this version, it’s where users could potentially manage their account information.
  - Logout: Ends the user session and logs them out of the system.

 8. Error Handling
- The program is designed to handle errors gracefully. If a user tries to access a page that doesn’t exist or if there’s an issue with the database, the program shows an error page.

 9. Running the Server
- Finally, the program starts the web server on a specific port (default is 8081). The server runs indefinitely, waiting for incoming requests from users.

 10. How It All Comes Together
- When you run the program, it sets up the necessary database tables, starts the server, and waits for users to interact with it through a web browser.
- Users can log in, manage their tickets, and interact with the system via a simple, text-based web interface.

 11. What You Can Learn
- This program is a good example of combining web development, database management, and basic user interaction in Python.
- It shows how to build a web server, handle HTTP requests, interact with a database, and manage user sessions.

 12. Next Steps for Learning
- If you’re new to these concepts, start by learning the basics of Python web development, such as handling HTTP requests and working with databases.
- Explore the `http.server` module to understand how web servers work.
- Look into `cx_Oracle` for interacting with Oracle databases.


By breaking down each part of the program, we can see how it all fits together to create a functional web application.
